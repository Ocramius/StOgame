This project contains code from an abandoned project: StOgame
StOgame.net was previously hosted on http://standardogame.mozdev.org,
where you can find older revisions of it. Please feel free to fork this project
and reuse it, as it's code is free and I've tried to do my best in squeezing any
possible feature from Firefox 3.5, but as you have seen, it's life came to an end.
Server-side code got lost and I don't have the money and will
to restore http://stogame.net 
Please just do a pull request, and I'll know that the project can continue its life

   Thank you for all your support Ogamers,
